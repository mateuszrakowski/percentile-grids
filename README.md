# Percentile Grids

A web-based application for calculating and visualizing percentile grids for brain structure volumes against a normative reference dataset. This tool is designed to help researchers and clinicians analyze brain development and identify potential abnormalities.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **Upload Your Data**: Supports both CSV and Excel file formats for input.
-   **Automated Age Calculation**: Automatically calculates subject age from date of birth and scan date.
-   **GAMLSS Modeling**: Utilizes Generalized Additive Models for Location, Scale, and Shape (GAMLSS) to generate accurate percentile values.
-   **Utilizes the R packages**: GAMLSS R packages are used to prepare correct results (the application uses the `rpy2` library to interface with R).
-   **Interactive Web Interface**: Built with Streamlit for a user-friendly experience.
-   **Reference Dataset Viewer**: A dedicated page to explore the underlying reference dataset.

## üöÄ Getting Started

This application is designed to be run using Docker to ensure a consistent and reliable environment.

### Prerequisites

-   Docker installed on your system.

### Running with Docker

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd percentile-grids
    ```

2.  **Build the Docker image:**
    From the root of the project directory, run the following command. This will build the image and tag it as `percentile-grids-app`.
    ```bash
    docker build -t percentile-grids-app .
    ```

3.  **Run the Docker container:**
    This command starts the container, maps port `8080` on your local machine to port `8080` inside the container, and mounts a local `data` directory for any data you might want the application to access.

    Make sure to run the docker command inside the cloned repository, as it will create the `data/` directory to store the models.
    ```bash
    docker run -p 8080:8080 percentile-grids-app
    ```

4.  **Access the application:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`.

## üìÅ Input Data Format

Currently the input data to the application is rigidly fixed and is generated from other software.
An example of the input data structure can be found in `scripts/original_mock.csv`.

##  Project Structure
